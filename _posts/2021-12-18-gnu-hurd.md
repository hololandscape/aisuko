I communicated to the developers of [gnu.org](http://gnu.org) And got many resource to help me continue to learn the GNU Hurd project.

These days, I realized that I need do a record of how to develop the GNU Hurd.


### Make sure you have permission to make change on the repositories

If you are a member of the project, make sure you follow the steps that add your public key of ssh on the Savannah website under your account. And GPG key(GPG keys are not used for Savannah operations, we upload it is used by the FSF for file uploads elsewhere.).

And there exist the many ways of getting a copy of the Git repository:

* Anonymous clone
  * read-only
  * `git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/hurd/hurd.git`

* Member clone
  * The way we can make changes on the project. It's not similar to the Github serials workflow.
  * For me  `git clone aisuko@git.savannah.gnu.org:/srv/git/hurd/hurd.git`

And there is a official document can help [here](https://savannah.gnu.org/maintenance/UsingGit/). As we can see from the document, that we should use the recommended protocols, like `ssh` and `https` in order to protect against possible man-in-the middle data corruption.
