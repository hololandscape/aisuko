## FFI
The Foreign Function Interface (FFI) is a feature of many programming languages that allows them to call functions and use data structures defined in another programming language or environment.

Rust provides a set of tools for working with the FFI, including a C-compatible function interface and tools for generating Rust binding to C libraries. And it with features such as automatic memory management and type safety.

```
extern "C" {
    fn my_c_function(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32;
}

fn my_rust_function(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    // this keyword is required because callling a C function from Rust can be unsafe.
    unsafe {
        my_c_function(x, y)
    }
}

```

## Which Rust libraries are suitable for embedding into the Rust?
And this may include implementing new Hurd servers or device drivers in Rust, or intergrating existing Rust libraries into the Hurd kernerl.

## What is the .mdwn file?
The .mdwn file extension is commonly used for Markdown files.
