## Availability Level
The percentage of uptime in a given time period(e.g: one year or one month).

|Availability %|Downtime(py)|Downtime(pm)|Downtime(pw)|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|99.8%|17.5h|86.2m|20.2m|
|99.9%(three nines)|8.8h|43.2m|10.1m|
|99.99%(four nines)|52.6m|4.3m|1.0m|
|99.999%(five nines)|5.3m|25.9s|6.1s|

For IT service, it is required to have above 99.8% or 99.9% availability pm. So, so the availability of underlying infrastructure must be higher.

## Measurement of Availability
* MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure)
* MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)

Availability can be measured
