## Analog signals
Analog data takes on continuous values, measured in hertz(Hz).
* Varies smoothly over time like audio, video, data sampled by sensor

Analog signal can be described as `sine wave`, it can be in `time domain` or `frequency domain`.
* `wavelength` of a signal is the distance occupied by a single cycle. =v*T 
  * (v is the speed of signal)
  * T is distance (the corresponding phase of two consecutive cycles)

### Sine wave
Sine wave has different amplitude and frequency

### Spectrum
The range of frequency a signal contains, it can be represent by `time-domain` and `frequency-domain` with a same vertical axis(amplitude)

### Bandwidth(Hz)
The width of the spectrum, bandwidth=(highest frequency -lowest frequency)


## Digital Signals
Digital data takes on discrete values, measured in bit per second(bps)
* Maintains a constant level then changes to another constant level, like text integers

Bit interval is the inverse of the bit rate, bit interval=1/(a bit rate)

## How to convert an analog signal into digital signal?
It has three steps and was called as `A/D Conversion`.

### Sampling
the input is continuous variable signals(theoretically infinite number of values)  
the output is the multi-level digital signals(has defined levels or states)  
outputs have levels (levels=2^(bit depth))  

### Quantization
* Sample analog signal(infinite) in time (horizontal)
* Find closest approximation to a finite set of known values(vertical)

Accuracy depends on sample interval and bit depth.

#### Sampling Theorem
Any transmission system has a limited band of frequencies(bandwidth)
The samples contain all the information of the original signal, if a rate higher than twice the highest signal frequency


#### Quantized and Quantization Errors
   
* Encoding

## Hamming code
