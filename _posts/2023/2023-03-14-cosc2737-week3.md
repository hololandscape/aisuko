## Analog signals
Analog data takes on continuous values, measured in `hertz(Hz)`.
* Varies smoothly over time like audio, video, data sampled by sensor

Analog signal can be described as `sine wave`, it can be in `time domain` or `frequency domain`.
* `wavelength` of a signal is the distance occupied by a single cycle. =v*T 
  * (v is the speed of signal)
  * T is distance (the corresponding phase of two consecutive cycles)

### Sine wave
Sine wave has different amplitude and frequency

### Spectrum
The range of frequency a signal contains, it can be represent by `time-domain` and `frequency-domain` with a same vertical axis(amplitude)

### Bandwidth(Hz)
The width of the spectrum, bandwidth=(highest frequency -lowest frequency)


## Digital Signals
Digital data takes on discrete values, measured in `bit per second(bps)`
* Maintains a constant level then changes to another constant level, like text integers

Bit interval is the inverse of the bit rate, bit interval=1/(a bit rate) us=10^6s

## How to convert an analog signal into digital signal?
It has three steps and was called as `A/D Conversion`.

### Sampling
the input is continuous variable signals(theoretically infinite number of values)  
the output is the multi-level digital signals(has defined levels or states)  
outputs have levels (levels=2^(bit depth))  

### Quantization
* Sample analog signal(infinite) in time (horizontal)
* Find closest approximation to a finite set of known values(vertical)

Accuracy depends on sample interval and bit depth.

#### Sampling Theorem
Any transmission system has a limited band of frequencies(bandwidth)
The samples contain all the information of the original signal, if a rate higher than twice the highest signal frequency.

Sample rate(sampling frequency=wave frequency) should be enough
* more wave frequency would be good record high quality(twice is enough, more is good but not useful, we need to balance trade off)


#### Quantized and Quantization Errors
3 is not enough level for good quality, so will cause error because error was related to quality.

### Transmission error
Redundancy for error detection

#### Parity check
* Even
* Cyclic redundancy check for big binary
  * CRC polynomial
  * how many bits in reminder? it depends on divisor
  * CRC calculation
  * 7 digit for ASCII code

### Encoding

## Hamming code
Detect and correct error

### Redundancy Bits Calculation
