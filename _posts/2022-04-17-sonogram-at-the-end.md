It's like `the stand up comedian`.

She sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the `carpet`.

How about `I will catch up you in the` ice age.

I'm still totally `paranoid`(adjective, characterized by).

Ha! It looks like she did not leave in such a hurry after all.

This is the `episode` of three's company where there is some kind of misunderstanding.

Oh, Then I have already seen this one.

Are you through with that? Yeah, sorry, the `swallowing` slowed me down.

`Whose little ball of paper is this`?

How `cruel` a parent can be about `the flatness of a child's pillow`?

You are like all `chaotic` and `twirly`.

`As far as my parents concerned`.

`Apparently`, they had some big ceremony before I was born.

`Ugly naked guy got a thigh master`

Like I was not `dreading` tomorrow enough.

`We will found it, won't we?`

All right, when did you have it on the last?

`Probably right before she lost it.`

I had it this morning.

Don't be mad. I gave you one job.

This is not a happy "Hi".

Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.

`Basically, It's totally up to me.`

Personally, the biggest part of your job is done.

`No matter what I do though I'm still going to be a engineer.`

`I think they are great. I really do.`

`They all had a thing for him.`

I'm sorry. Why is that girl going to call me?

Could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?

`I know this going to sound unbelievably selfish on my part. But were you planning on bringing up the whole xxxx things? Cause I think it might takes some of the heat off me.`

`What that Monika did to her life?`

`We ran into her parents at the club`. They were not playing well.

I'm not going to tell you.

`What's that supposed to mean?` Nothing, It's an expression.

Your puzzles.

The people like Rose who need to shoot for the stars. Other people are `satisfied` with `staying` where they are. `These are the people` who never get cancer.

I read about these women and trying to have it all.

`What's going on with you?` Any stories, no news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks.

Look, I `realize you guys have been wondering` what `exactly` happened between xx and xxx. So, here is the deal.

`Folks really that bad, huh?`

`Must pee`

`You know. It's even worse when you are twins.`

I have `kind up` got to clean now.

`Hit the lights, please.`

`How long was I in there?`

`I will go down here.`

When did it get so complicated?     Got me. Me neither.

`Sorry, I'm late. I got stuck at work.` There was this big dinosaur thing. Anyway.

`She's familiar` with the special situation.

Come and in. `He'll be here for hours`. how are you ding?

I'm okay. You look great. Yeah, well.

He is `gagging`. `Be right here`. `Be back in seconds.`

I believe Julia `on the table`.

`What have you been up to? Not much. I got a job. That's great.`

`Why are you so tan?`

`My maid of honor`

I have ever wanted to hurt you. I guess this belongs to you.

I do not remember you making any `sperm`. Yeah, and we all know `what a challenge that is`. `See, see?` You two stop it.

`No, She get credit. I'm in here too.`

`You are not actually suggesting` of course not.

Then he get his way. `You know what`, this is too hard.

Any `nausea`. a little.

I `was just wondering about the mother to be.`

`lie back`

What are we `supposed` to be seeing here?

`You are welling up.`

If `everything works out` and you guys `end up` getting married and having and everything.

I know it was a `cheap shot`. But I feel much better now.
