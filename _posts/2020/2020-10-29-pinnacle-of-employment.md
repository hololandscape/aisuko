The original blog from [Jayconcrod-leaving-google](https://jayconrod.com/posts/122/leaving-google)

I'd like to say I love this blog. And the reason is that I have same idea with the author.

And we can see we can learn many lessons from the blog. But I'd like to talks on two main aspects.


First, the pinnacle of employment. For my opinion, I believe this should not be exist any more. The world more and more goes into the virtualization. As we know the macOS latest release add all features relate to `remote`, like new feature on FaceTime, spatial audio technology. And more creator on YouTube and other short-video contents creator.

So, I mean the internet change the world. That is not mean you are in a super city take 1~2 hours the subway every day go to company and develop the modern servers. I believe the internet changes the trust model of the world. 

**What's the mean of trust-model?**

The concept is, if people do not have to concern the resource occupy by others. I believe they can trust each other with no reason. These can be occur on the virtual feature with the technology. And all people do their job for solve the real problem. [Alfred Adler's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler) psychology can help us here.


Actually, I don't understand the dream and honor comes from the large or super companies. And people should to learn the knowledge which the school didn't teach us.

* What's the money?
* What's the finance?
* Is here everything need to compete?


Another here is the language GO. To be honest, I'm studying on Rust many months. I'd like to develop some tool for GNU Hurd. If I can replace some tool or fix the issue.


**Lessons**

Use the new trust-model to look at the world and embrace the dream.
