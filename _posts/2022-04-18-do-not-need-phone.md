I hate that human limited by the phone.

Trying to imagine, people can receive information anytime in anywhere without trying to find something new from the little screen which it is limited by the electricity.

I'm not sure this kind of technology I wanna to talk about is AR or VR. But I believe the most important thing in here is:

The imagining should not limited, and try to think new way to connect with the world. I mean here is that the phone is a normal way people connect to the internet, but there are many ways. Also some of them are limited the current technology. But I need to find out it. If not, the world is boring for me.


Try to imagine the little component can help you in everywhere on anytime. For example, it looks like "Focus" in [Horizon Zero Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Zero_Dawn)
