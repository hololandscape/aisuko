Also I am 100% VIP of KFC. But here is the gap, my favorite sport is sleep(If we count sleep in the multiple types of sports.).

So, Here is some thing not good for me. These types of foods like hamburger, French Fries(chips), Chicken etc. which foods with high calories.

I'm totally not interested in construct the body within the gym.

So, here is a conclusion. I totally do not need these calories and too much meat make me feel not very well.


Actually, I'd like to have some beans. I really do. It's the congee with multiple beans and red bean paste, vegetables is enough.
