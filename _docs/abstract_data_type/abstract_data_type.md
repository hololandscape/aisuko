## Abstract Data Type

> ADTs are a theoretical concept, used in the design and analysis of algorithms, data structures and software systems.

> In computer science, ADT is a mathematical model for data types. It is defined by its behavior from the point of view of a user, of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.

> This mathematical model contrasts with data strcutures, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user.

ADT may be defined as a "class of objects whose logical behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations".


## Defining an abstract data type

An abstract data type is defined as a mathematical model of the data objects that make up a data type as well as the functions that operate on these objects. There are no standard conventions for defining them.
