## Data structure

> In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.


### Usage

Data structures serve as the basis for abstract data types(ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.
