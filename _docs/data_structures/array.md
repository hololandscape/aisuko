## Arrays are important data structures
* They are used to implement many other structures, like `lists` and `strings`.

## Term "Array"
Array may also refer to `array data type`. Array types are often implemented by array structures, in some languages they may be implemented by hash tables, linked lists,search trees, or other data structures.

Arrays are used to implement mathematical vectors and matrices, data structures like lists, heaps, hash tables, deques, stacks, strings and VLists.

Array-based implementations of other data structures are frequently simple and space-efficient, good space overhead, but may have poor space complexity(when modified)

## Term "Dynamic Array"

In computer science, a dynamic array, growable array, resizable array, dynamic table, mutable array, or array list is a random access, variable-size list data structure that allows elements to be added or removed.

## In algorithms
The term `array` in algorithms means associative array or "abstract array".

## Efficiency
Both `store` and `select` take constant time. Arrays take linear `O(n)` space in the number of elements n that they hold.

Array accesses with statically predictable access patterns are a major source of data parallelism.
