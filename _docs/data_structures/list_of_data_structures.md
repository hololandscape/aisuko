## Primitive types

> In computer science, primitive data types are a set of basic data types from which all other data types are constructed. Data types which are not primitive are referred to as derived or composite.


* Boolean
* Character
* Floating-point numbers
* Fixed-point numbers
* Integer
* Reference(also called a pointer or handle)
* Enumerated type(a small set of uniquely named values)
* Date Time


## Composite types or non-primitive type
* Array(String is an array of characters)
* Record(structure)
* Union(variant)

## Abstract data types
