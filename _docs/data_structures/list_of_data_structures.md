## Data types

### Primitive types

> In computer science, `primitive data types` are `a set of basic data types` from which all other data types are constructed. Data types which are not primitive are referred to as derived or composite.

* Boolean
* Character
* Floating-point numbers
* Fixed-point numbers
* Integer
* Reference(also called a pointer or handle)
* Enumerated type(a small set of uniquely named values)
* Date Time


### Composite types or non-primitive type
* Array(String is an array of characters)
* Record(structure)
* Union(variant)


### Abstract data types
* List
* Tuple
* Associative array, Map
* Multimap
* Set
* Multiset(bag)
* Stack
* Queue(Priority queue)
* Double-ended queue
* Graph(Tree, Heap)


## Linear data structures

### Arrays
* Array
* Bitmap
* Dynamic array
* Hashed array tree
* Matrix


### Lists
* Double linked list
* Array list
* Linked list
* Association list


## Trees

### Binary trees
* AA/AVL tree
* Binary search tree
* Binary tree
* Red-black tree
* T-tree
* WAVL tree
* Weight-balanced tree

### B-trees
* B-tree
* B+ tree

### Heaps
* Heap
* Binary Heap
* B-heap
* Fibonacci heap


## Hash-based structures
* Distributed hash table
* Double hashing
* Dynamic perfect hash table
* Hash array mapped trie
* Hash list
* Hash table
* Hash trie


## Graphs
* Graph
* Decision tree
  * Binary decision diagram
* Hypergraph
