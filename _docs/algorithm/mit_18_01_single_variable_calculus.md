## Derivatives
There are not all the units of the course which means I only pick up some simple concepts support to design the algorithms.
* Geometric interpretation
* Physical interpretation
* Important for any measurement(economics, political, science, finance, physics, etc)


## What is a derivatives?
The derivative is the slope of the lin tangent to the graph of f(x).

### what is a tangent line, exactly?
* It is NOT just a line that meets the graph at one point.
* It is the `limit` of the secant line(a line drawn between two points on the graph) as the distance between the two points goes to zero.

### Notations
Calculus, rather like English or any other language, was developed by several people. As a result, just as there are many ways to express the same thing, there are many notations for the derivative.


## Limits, Continuity, and Trigonometric Limits
Easy Limits
* It only needs to plug in the limiting value to get a meaningful answer.
