# Unit 1: Derivatives
* Geometric interpretation
* Physical interpretation
* Important for any measurement(economics, political, science, finance, physics, etc)

### A. What is a derivatives?

The derivative is the slope of the lin tangent to the graph of f(x). 

#### But what is a tangent line, exactly?

* It is NOT just a line that meets the graph at one point.
* It is the `limit` of the secant line(a line drawn between two points on the graph) as the distance between the two points goes to zero.


### B. How to differentiate any function you know.
