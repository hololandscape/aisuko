# Derivatives

There are not all the units of the course which means I only pick up some simple concepts support to design the algorithms.

* Geometric interpretation
* Physical interpretation
* Important for any measurement(economics, political, science, finance, physics, etc)


## A. What is a derivatives?

The derivative is the slope of the lin tangent to the graph of f(x).

### But what is a tangent line, exactly?

* It is NOT just a line that meets the graph at one point.
* It is the `limit` of the secant line(a line drawn between two points on the graph) as the distance between the two points goes to zero.

### Notations

Calculus, rather like English or any other language, was developed by several people. As a result, just as there are many ways to express the same thing, there are many notations for the derivative.


# Limits, Continuity, and Trigonometric Limits

## Limits and Continuity

* Easy Limits

It only needs to plug in the limiting value to get a meaningful answer.

* Limits and Continuity

* Removable Discontinuity

* Jump Discontinuity
* Infinite Discontinuity
* Other discontinuities
