### Steam Deck and Steam Deck Dock

I got my Steam Deck and Steam Deck Dock. Thanks to Miss Lydia. You will have a great feature. (Gorgeous)

In my view, it is a portable laptop with customizing of your idea. This is also remind me, not only focus on software also hardware too.

### Steam Deck Dock 4k 60Mhz

I almost never got any of good performance game environment. (Only have PS4 and PS5). So, I am exciting to know about if it can support 4k/120Mhz.


By the way, UPS is so fast than I thought. It is a good service for shipping luggage between different countries.
