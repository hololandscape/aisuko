I'm Bowen Li, the code name is **Aisuko**. It's looks great.


I'd like to do something real interesting, like explore on the GNU Hurd project. The project same age with me, it's really cool.

And I'd like to explore the structure of the whole world. So I'm not interesting in the server, but the infrastructures are need to update here.

I'd like to research more of the [microkernel](https://dev.to/aisuko/the-concepts-of-microkernel-3i08) because the HA or distribution servers work on a monolithic kernel is not stable(It's a joke). And there lots of things need to learn and research.

And lots of basic automatic tools there must have I guess.

And I'm a Sky photographer [Flickr](https://flickr.com/people/aisukoli/) and all the photos are free to download.
